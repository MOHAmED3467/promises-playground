## 📌 Features
- **Task 1: Promise Basics**  
  User enters a message → after 2 seconds it is displayed.

- **Task 2: Promise Chaining**  
  User enters a number → multiply by 2 → subtract 3 → show result.

- **Task 3: Error Handling**  
  If user types `error` → Promise rejects with an error.  
  Otherwise, it resolves with the entered text.

- **Task 4: Custom Input**  
  User enters any text → Promise converts it to **UPPERCASE**.
